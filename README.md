A neat, easy way to track your encounters when playing a Pokemon Nuzlocke. The idea is to be wide-reaching enough that you are not stuck to only base games by allowing for the ability to enter any encounter name, location, and eventually any type changes done 
in the desired game. The landing page can place you on the other pages.

The Encounter Table page is the main piece of the program. The page includes:
1. At the top is the ability to select a .csv file to load or save. If you click save without selecting a file, a text prompt will appear for you to enter a file name to be saved to the included Tables\ folder. 
    There is no need to include the .csv into the filename as the program will add that automatically after clicking the create button.
2. An expandable section to add encounters to the table. The information able to be input are: Pokemon caught, encounter location, the ability of the mon, the mon's nature, and fields for each IV of the mon going from 0-31. After filling in all desired information, clicking
    the Enter button will add the full entry into the table.
3. The table shows all encounters. The table can be sorted by clicking on a column to sort either alphabetically or numerically.
4. The page will be receiving more functionality in the future.

Analytics page to be added soon.


The project is open source, so feel free to take the project and customize it to your needs and wants. Want to make adding an encounter a dropdown of all the Pokemon? Go ahead. Ability to link with another to run a soul link? Go nuts. This was a project for me to learn
the Python frontend Streamlits, Pandas and my overall Python skillset.
